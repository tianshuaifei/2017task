## Chinese Word Semantic Relation Classification
This task is focused on lexical semantics and it aims to evaluate the techniques of automatic classification of Chinese word semantic relations. Given a pair of Chinese words, it is required to classify the word pair into one of the following semantic relations: synonym (e.g., 计算机-电脑), antonym (e.g., 上涨-下降), hyponym (e.g., 食材-红薯), meronymy (e.g., 汽车-发动机) and person-affiliation relation (e.g., 医生-医院).
## News Headline Categorization
This task aims to evaluate the automatic classification techniques for very short texts, i.e., Chinese news headlines. Each news headline (i.e., news title) is required to be classified into one or more predefined categories.
## Single Document Summarization
This task provides a dataset for single document summarization of Chinese news articles, to evaluate and compare different document summarization techniques.
## Emotional Conversation Generation
As a vital part of human intelligence, emotional intelligence is defined as the ability to perceive, integrate, understand, and regulate emotions. Though a variety of models have been proposed for conversation generation from large-scale social data, it is still quite challenging (and yet to be addressed) to generate emotional responses. In this shared task, participants are expected to generate Chinese responses that are not only appropriate in content but also adequate in emotion, which is quite important for building an empathic chatting machine. For instance, if user says “My cat died yesterday”, the most appropriate response may be “It’s so sad, so sorry to hear that”to express sadness, but also could be “Bad things always happen, I hope you will be happy soon” to express comfort.
## Open Domain Question Answering
Open domain QA evaluation includes three tasks, knowledge-based question answering (KBQA), document-based question answering (DBQA), and table-based question answering (TBQA). The task of KBQA is to answer Chinese factoid questions based on a given structured knowledge base. The task of DBQA is to answer Chinese questions by selecting one or multiple sentences from a given document as answers. In addition to the training and test sets released in NLPCC-ICCPOL 2016, this year, we will provide two new test sets for the above two tasks respectively. The task of TBQA is a totally new QA task, which aims to answer English questions by retrieving one or more tables from a table collection as answers. We hope our datasets and evaluation can promote the development of QA research in China.
## Social Media User Modeling
User modeling on social media is essential for business decisions, such as user segmentation and targeting advertisement. Since user behavioral data on social media is heterogeneous, it’s still challenging to effectively leverage the heterogeneous information for user modeling. This task provides a social media dataset including the following heterogeneous information: users’ profiles (such as gender, age), social ties (following relationship), users’ tags, users’ published tweets, and users’ location visits. The user modeling task include the following two subtasks: 1) Interested Location Prediction, given users’ some historical location visits and other provided information, predict what locations a user is interested to visit in the future. 2) User Profiling, given users’ other information expect profiles, predict each user’s profile information.
